# Jon's Fight with Stage 4 Metastatic Melanoma
13 Sept 2023

> Many of you know that Jon Henner has been giving the finger to cancer for the last 6 years. I'm heartbroken to tell you that Jon left this mortal coil on Monday, August 14th at 7:16am.
>
> The celebration of life for Jon Henner will be October 14th, at 6pm, in Greensboro, NC. All are welcome to the [first annual Jon-a-thon](https://www.evite.com/event/004EIEMU3LNY6YKLKEPOJN2YUZPHKQ).
>
> Emily, the children, and Jon's beloved family are finding their way forward during this time and greatly appreciate all the support they have received. With Jon gone, your gifts help Emily and the girls move forward without major medical debt as they navigate this new and challenging life.
