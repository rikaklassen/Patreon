# Please help a friend go through college! (updated)
26 Dec 2023

I have a dear friend who [asked for some financial assistance](https://www.patreon.com/posts/please-help-go-76492365) in autumn of 2021 and they was going to school full-time without support from the government amidst lockdowns and cutting back on CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit). It's a three-years program.

One of those three years is already completed. They decided not go back to school in autumn of 2022 and throughout 2023.

Here are the updated finances for 2024 (estimates only; subject to change):
- $6,077 CAD for tuition and student fees (per year)
- $6,000 CAD living allowance ($200/week)
- $200 CAD for books and supplies
- $500 CAD for tutoring
- $200 CAD for community events
- $140 CAD for membership
- $303.70 CAD bus pass
Laptop required, but there is no number on how much the laptop should cost.

Rent's not yet calculated. Nor other expenses.

Feel free to help her out: [paypal.me/bglamours](https://paypal.me/bglamours).

(Still promised or owed them $25,000 for 2021 - 2022 but that's a different topic altogether.)
